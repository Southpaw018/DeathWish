SquallSeeD31: Squall's original HeroicDeath plugin was much beloved on my server, and it's been missed since he stopped development. In addition to being the sole inspiration for DeathWish, I've used a dozen or so lines of his original code and his original format for messages, so they're compatible. Credit and many thanks to him for his hard work on the original.
